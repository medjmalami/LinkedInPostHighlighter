# LinkedIn Recent Posts Highlighter

A Firefox extension that highlights LinkedIn posts less than 24 hours old with a green border.

## Why?

Skip the noise and jump directly into fresh, relevant posts on your LinkedIn feed.

## Installation

1. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
2. Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Select the `manifest.json` file from this folder
5. Go to LinkedIn and start scrolling!

## How it works

- Scans your LinkedIn feed for post timestamps (e.g., "3h", "45m", "12h")
- Posts under 24 hours old get highlighted with a green left border
- Automatically detects new posts as you scroll

## Status

🚧 Work in Progress (v1)
